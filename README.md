This is a solo-project, aimed to help me study classifying techniques.

It predicts the outcome of a tennis match based on who is playing against whom,
taking into account the players' ranking, the terrain etc.

It uses data published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis),
originating from this [Github repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp).
