This is a solo-project, aimed to help me study classifying techniques. It also serves the
purpose of helping me learn how to upscale by creating the corresponding modules
and such techniques.

I have put significant effort into engineering new features which potentially hold
significant predictive power for the outcome of a tennis match.

The MVP has been a logistic regression including no player associated statistic
other than their current rank, age, height and hand. It's accuracy is about 67-68%
on the test sets, however, only 3 years of data have been used at once at the most.

The data I am using has been published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis),
originating from this [Github repo](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp).
